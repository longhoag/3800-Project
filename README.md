# 3800-Project: Client-server Web Chat Application

##Introduction
This project is the client and server chat application website. The website displays a basic chat room interface allowing users to login with their unique usernames and chat with other users. 
##Project description
###Overview
	This project aims to create a chatting room environment, whose server will record any messages from a client and display them to other users in the group chat. The goal of the project is to log users into the group chat, and allow them to send and receive messages from other users in real-time.
User Interface
The project website features a simple chat room interface with two main pages: sign up page and group chat page. 
The sign up page will allow users to sign up and join the group chat by entering their username and clicking the "Join" button. 
The group chat page will appear once a user joins the group chat, where they can send and see messages from other users in the group chat. This screen includes a header with an "Leave Chat" button option to leave the chat, a container for displaying messages, and a section for typing and sending messages. 
###Programming Languages
	This project website is created using HTML for the structures, CSS for the styling, and JavaScript for the functionality. The server which hosts the website is created using Node.js.
